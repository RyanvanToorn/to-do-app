# Learnings from this project

## Github:

- Basically redid my entire github account and almost all repos, completely bugged out my VSCode + Github sync in the process,
  but the root cause was my initial lack of knowledge RE local vs remote Repos and how github works.
- Created a 'GitGuide' file for personal use containing the common console commands and what they do - will primarily use
  the built in Source Control UI to facilitate this, but it's valuable knowledge regardless.
- Furthered my understanding of best practices, specifically not YOLO working on the primary branch and straight committing.

## MUI:

-

## TypeScript:

-
