# Questions from this project (Ideally BP related)

- 1. Is it best practice to declare :datatype for a const/var even though it's automatically implied (see useDeviceTypes hook)
- 2. I'm assuming using a named export is always best practice? Even if the file only exports a single item.
- 3. Since my current understanding and usage of git is sketchy at best - what does the typical process look like? Say I'm creating a new component.
